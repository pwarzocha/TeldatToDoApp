How it works:
Run visual studio (.net sdk needed) and run app from visual studio or publish.

About:
- web application
- based on local db with configuration that provides some initial data
- tasks are called UserTasks just for type clearance, but I know that this choice may not be as popular as Task
- rest API covers geting userTasks by date, adding new userTasks, del;eting existing one, modifying existing one
- Users exists but are rather for eventual future development than as a stand-alone feature
- due to very busy scheadule I could not afford to spend more time on unit tests, handling exceptions and unexpected behavior or making it pretty, but I'm aware that those are things that should be addressed in normal project
